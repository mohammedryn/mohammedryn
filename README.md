## 🚀 What Drives Me

I build machines that think, adapt, and assist. Whether it’s a self-balancing robot that learns through reinforcement, a home automation system that predicts power anomalies, or Building intelligent systems that empower people with disabilities — enabling independence, inclusion, and dignity through assistive technology — my work lives where **circuits meet cognition**.
